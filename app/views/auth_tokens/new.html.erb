      <h3 data-slidetarget="whyUseful">Why is this useful?</h3>
      <div data-slide="whyUseful">
        <p>Instead of secrets being sent by email, in support systems, via instant messaging services or the like, a unique link is sent instead, which only works once.</p>
        <p>This way, only an unusable link will remain protecting the secret from further prying eyes.</p>

      <h3 data-slidetarget="whyTrust">Why should we trust you?</h3>
      <div data-slide="whyTrust">
        <p>We built this service to solve our own problem of sharing secrets with customers. We know trust is a thing, so we open sourced the whole project for any peer review.</p>
        <p>If you find something, please let us know or send a pull request and we'll get it fixed.</p>

      <h3 data-slidetarget="secretsStored">Are secrets stored?</h3>
      <div data-slide="secretsStored">
        <p>Yes, but encrypted with a one way cipher that we don't have the key for. The key is only sent to the receipient you specify.</p>
        <p>Once the secret is read by the recipient, we even delete the encrypted version from the database, just leaving the meta data behind so in future versions you can have a dashboard to see what you sent to whom (coming soon).</p>

      <h3 data-slidetarget="howMuch">How much does this cost?</h3>
      <div data-slide="howMuch">
        <p>It's free for you to use to send secrets to whomever you want - we just ask that you don't do anything that could be against the law or harrass anyone with this service.</p>
        <p>We might introduce a paid version to allow other things (like history) or sending larger files and the like, but all of that is still being worked out, for now, enjoy :)</p>
