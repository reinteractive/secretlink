            on our servers, so once sent, that's it, you, us, anyone except the person recieving the email can not decrypt
            the secret.

          <p class="lead">Why is this useful?</p>
          <p>
            Instead of secrets being sent by email, in support systems, via instant messaging services
            or the like, a unique link is sent instead, which only works once.
          </p>
          <p>
            This way, only an unusable link will remain protecting the secret from further prying eyes.

          <p class="lead">Why should we trust you?</p>
          <p>
            We built this service to solve our own problem of sharing secrets with customers. We know
            trust is a thing, so we <%= link_to("open sourced the whole project", "https://github.com/reinteractive/topsekrit") %> for any peer review.

          <p class="lead">Are secrets stored?</p>
          <p>
            Yes, but encrypted with a one way cipher that we don't have the key for.
            The key is only sent to the receipient you specify.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the secret is read by the recipient, we even delete the encrypted version
            from the database, just leaving the meta data behind so in future versions you
            can have a dashboard to see what you sent to whom (comming soon).

            It's free for you to use to send secrets to whomever you want - we
            just ask that you don't do anything that could be against the law
            or harrass anyone with this service.
          </p>
          <p>
            We might introduce a paid version to allow other things (like history)
            or sending larger files and the like, but all of that is still being
            worked out, for now, enjoy :)
