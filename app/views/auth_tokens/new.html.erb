          <p>
            Instead of secrets being sent by email, in support systems, via instant messaging services
            or the like, a unique link is sent instead, which only works once.
          </p>

            Yes, but encrypted with a one way cipher that we don't have the key for.
            The key is only sent to the receipient you specify.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the secret is read by the recipient, we even delete the encrypted version

            can have a dashboard to see what you sent to whom (comming soon).
