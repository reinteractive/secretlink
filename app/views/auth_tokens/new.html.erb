  <li>Enter your email address and a link with a one-time authentication token will be sent to you.</li>
  <li>Follow the link to a page where you can view the status of previously shared secrets and share new secrets.</li>
  <li>Enter the recipients email address, and enter or attach the secret information.</li>
  <li>A link with a one-time authentication token is sent to the recipient's address.</li>

  <li>The secret information is encrypted. A component of the decryption key is sent in the email to the recipient and not stored in the database.</li>
  <li>Secrets have an optional expiry.</li>
  <li>Sending this information via email or a chat application isn't particularly secure or professional. Ideally the recipient would view the secret and save it in a password manager application, but this isn't required.</li>
