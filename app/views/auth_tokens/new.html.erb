          <p class="lead">Why is this useful?</p>
          <p>
            Instead of secrets being sent by email, in support systems, via instant messaging services
            or the like, a unique link is sent instead, which only works once.
          </p>
          <p>
            This way, only an unusable link will remain protecting the secret from further prying eyes.

          <p class="lead">Why should we trust you?</p>
          <p>
            We built this service to solve our own problem of sharing secrets with customers. We know
            trust is a thing, so we <%= link_to("open sourced the whole project", "https://github.com/reinteractive/topsekrit") %> for any peer review.

          <p class="lead">Are secrets stored in the database?</p>
          <p>
            Yes, but only until the secret is consumed, then we only keep the meta data
            in the system for your reference.
          </p>
          <p>
            In future versions we will implement a simple dashboard allowing you to
            view the meta data of what was sent and when it was consumed.  But we'll
            never keep the original secret in the database. This is an important
            security feature.

          <p class="lead">How much does this cost?</p>
          <p>
            It's free for you to use to send secrets to whomever you want - we
            just ask that you don't do anything that could be against the law
            or harrass anyone with this service.
          </p>
          <p>
            We might introduce a paid version to allow other things (like history)
            or sending larger files and the like, but all of that is still being
            worked out, for now, enjoy :)
